		<q>War is 90% information</q> - Napoleon Bonaparte<br>
Data is becoming the new raw material of business. Master it and you'll be welcomed nearly everywhere.<br>

IET, the DTU Student Chapter in association with Renaissance , INVICTUS presents you <strong>CEREBRAL</strong>, a data science enthusiast event. The challenge is ingesting and interpreting the data to determine which data is useful to solve a community-based problem through the eyes of data. It is the perfect way to improve your skills and update your knowledge. <br>

This is the right time to apply everything you have learned so far. So let's compete with our own-selves to see if we can cope up with this heavily unbalanced dataset, which resembles the real-life data.<br>

Participate in teams of up to 4 members.<br>
Cross College teams are also allowed<br>
UG/PG collab is allowed<br>
<strong>Registration fees - NIL</strong><br>

Refreshments will be provided to the participants<br><br>
